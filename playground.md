Boids! Based on the [original model by Craig Reynolds](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/), written in the [p5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/), and inspired by the [boids found in Xen in the original Half Life](https://youtu.be/ucPLCf05VrI).  

Left click and drag the mouse to create new boids on the cursor!

A simple web "theremin" written in the [p5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) and using the [p5.sound library](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-sound). Set up with a simple square wave oscillator, low pass filter, and reverb effect chained together.  

Left click and drag the mouse to play, mouse X is mapped to the oscillator frequency (between ranges 100 and 500), where mouse Y is mapped to the low pass filter frequency.
